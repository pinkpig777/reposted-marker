# LinkedIn Reposted Marker 🔎

LinkedIn Reposted Marker is a Chrome and Edge extension that helps you spot reposted LinkedIn job listings at a glance, before you waste time opening the wrong role.

## Why It Exists ✨

LinkedIn Jobs often hides the most useful signal until after you click into a posting. This extension brings that signal forward by checking job cards, checking the open detail panel, and filling in the gaps with background prefetch.

## What It Does

- 🎯 Highlights reposted jobs in the left jobs list
- 🧭 Highlights reposted jobs in the right detail panel
- ⚙️ Prefetches unresolved jobs in the background
- 💾 Reuses local cache to reduce duplicate work
- 🩺 Shows runtime diagnostics in the popup, including page support, queue state, and cache state
